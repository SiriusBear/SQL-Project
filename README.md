# SQL-Project
SQL project as done as a final project for data anayltic class

The goal of the submission was to accurately and completely summarize 1 real-world written business report created from the sample dataset.
Video store rental palace has requested an analysis of the most rented actors and their movies in their
store. The goal is to find a popular actor and use that information to promote more movies from them
and thus increase their sales.
The data used in this report include VARCHAR, INT, and DATE. To gather that data, several tables from
the DVD rental database will be used. These tables include Actor, Rental, Film_Actor, Inventory, and
Film. To make the summary table more readable, a transformation must be made to the actor table.
First a new column called actor_name must be created, then the transformation concatenates the first
and last name field into one column and inserts it into the new column that was created. This helps with
readability and will ultimately help when creating the summary and detailed table.
With the detailed table, a query can be run to check which actor appears the most, thus table will
include all the actor names, movies, and dates rented. A simple query can then be run to count the
number of appearances an actor makes, which then gives the answer we are looking for. Using that
information, the summary table can be made to include only that actor, the movies they appeared in,
and the number of times that movie was rented.
For this to supply the most up to date information, the tables should be refreshed every two weeks to
make sure the information doesnâ€™t become stale and so engagement can remain high. The reason to
have this refresh is to keep customer engagement high and to cycle through the actors and promote
different films to capture the popularity of said actor.

For the report various SQL code was used and can be summarzied as below:
